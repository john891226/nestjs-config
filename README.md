## Description
---
Configuration module for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) based on: [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) (to load process environment variables), [YAML](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml) (to load .yml|.yaml configuration files);

Allows reading recursively a config folder and loading all configuration files to a unique object, creating a prototype chain for configuration properties inheritance;
## Installation

yarn add @
```
